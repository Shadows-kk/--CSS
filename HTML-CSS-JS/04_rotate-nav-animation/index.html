        <h3>My Dog</h3>
        <img src="./img/timg.jpeg" alt="doggy" />
        <p>
          A Night's Watch deserter is tracked down outside of Winterfell,
          prompting swift justice from Lord Eddard 'Ned' Stark, and raising
          concerns about the dangers in the lawless lands north of the Wall.
          Returning home, Ned learns from his wife Catelyn that his mentor, Jon
          Arryn, has died in the Westeros capital of King's Landing, and that
          King Robert is on his way north to offer Ned the position as the
          King's Hand. Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea in Pentos, Viserys
          Targaryen hatches a plan to win back the throne by forging an
          allegiance with the nomadic Dothraki warriors by giving its leader,
          Khal Drogo, his lovely sister Daenerys's hand in marriage. Robert
          arrives at Winterfell with his wife, Queen Cersei, and other members
          of the Lannister family: her twin brother Jaime, dwarf brother Tyrion,
          and Cersei's son and heir to the throne, 12-year-old Joffrey. Unable
          to refuse his old friend and king, Ned prepares to leave for King's
          Landing, as Jon Snow decides to travel north to Castle Black to join
          the Night's Watch, accompanied by a curious Tyrion. But a startling
          act of treachery directed at young Bran may end up postponing their
          respective departures.
